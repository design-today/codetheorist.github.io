<p>Welcome and thank you for checking out my website. Please feel free to view & use any of the source code used to build the site, which is available <a href="https://github.com/codetheorist/codetheorist.github.io" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>The site is built using Jekyll and features some unique tricks to acheive some of the additional functionality. I would highly recommend checking out the way some of the features have been implemented, especially if you are new to <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> development.</p>
