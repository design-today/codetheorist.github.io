<p>During my recent escapades with Vagrant, I decided to find out just how easy it actually is to create your own Vagrant base box. I have uploaded my finished base box to the Hashicorp directory and it's available <a href="https://atlas.hashicorp.com/codetheorist/boxes/trusty64" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<!-- more -->
<p>If you wish to use the Codetheorist base box for your development work, it's simply a case of running the command below.</p>
{% highlight bash %}
  vagrant init codetheorist/trusty64 && vagrant up
{% endhighlight %}
<p><strong>Please note:</strong> I have not setup any sync'd files for webapps, as do to filesystem limitations between Linux & Windows and the way in which Virtualbox implements sync'd files & folders, it is currently quicker & easier to use an FTP program to edit files on the box</p>
