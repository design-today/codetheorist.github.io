<p>In this guide, we'll run through setting up a basic workflow using Grunt.</p>
<p>We'll be running through setting up basic package.json, Gruntfile.js, compass configuration and bower files.</p>
<p>After our workflow has been setup, we'll have full SASS/SCSS imports & processing from our 'bower_components' directory, as well as CSS & JS minification with file watching and livereload.</p>
