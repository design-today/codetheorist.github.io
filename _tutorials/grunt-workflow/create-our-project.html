<p>Our first step in creating our Grunt project, is to create a directory for our files to live in, so go ahead and create a folder.</p>
<p>Once you have created the directory, create a file named 'package.json'. For the bare minimum, our package.json file <strong>MUST</strong> include a 'name' and a 'version', however to stop NPM moaning at us, we will also include the license, repository & description fields.</p>
<p>You can either use the example below as-is, or modify it with your own package name, etc.</p>
{% highlight json %}
{
  "name": "grunt-workflow",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A sample Grunt workflow.",
  "license": "ISC",
  "repository": " "
}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>Seeing as though you should be using version control, we'll also take this opportunity to create a '.gitignore' file, the content of which is below. This will stop all of your bower & npm packages being submitted to version control, as well as any SASS cache files & log files.</p>
{% highlight bash %}
/node_modules
/bower_components
/dist
*.log
/.sass-cache
{% endhighlight %}
<p>Once we've created these files, we-re ready to submit our files to version control. Copy and paste the following commands to create our repo and submit our files.</p>
{% highlight bash %}
git init
git add --all
git commit -m "Project skeleton"
{% endhighlight %}
<p>Now our files are version controlled, we can now proceed to the next stage - installing some Grunt packages and creating our Gruntfile.</p>
